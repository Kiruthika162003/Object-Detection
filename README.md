# Object-Detection


## How It Works
1. **Data Preparation**: The code begins by loading and preprocessing the dataset. This involves resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and creating bounding box annotations for the objects in the images.
2. **Model Architecture**: The code utilizes a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically designed for object detection. Popular architectures like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) may be used.
3. **Training**: The model is trained on the prepared dataset using a combination of loss functions that account for both object classification and localization. The training process involves multiple epochs, where the model learns to detect objects by minimizing the loss.
4. **Inference**: Once trained, the model can be used to detect objects in new images. The code takes an input image, processes it through the trained model, and outputs the detected objects along with their bounding boxes and confidence scores.
5. **Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU). These metrics help in assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of the object detection model.
6. **Visualization**: The code includes functionality to visualize the detected objects on the input images. This helps in understanding the model's performance and identifying any areas for improvement.
